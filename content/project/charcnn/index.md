title: PyTorch implementation and extension of Character Level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification
summary: Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of treating text at the character level and applying convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification on various datasets. An ablation study and test on a sarcasm detection dataset provide further insights into the architecture.
