Watching  this video as a freshman on summer break changed my life. 
The power of deep learning and its potential to positively impact people excites me to this day.

On my journey of exploring deep learning and its applications, I have obtained versatile experience in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing through both research and industry roles. Previously, I was a NLP Engineer at LimeChat, boosting sales and automating customer support for D2C brands by developing new features for India's first Level 3 AI chatbot.

I graduated from NIT Trichy with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. Through my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to have the able guidance of bright minds such as [Prof. Liming Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/limingchen/accueil), [Prof. CV Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). I am grateful for receiving the [Charpak Lab Scholarship](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship) which enabled me to pursue a research internship in France and the [SPDC scholarship](https://mea.gov.in/spdc.htm) which funded part of my undergraduate education.
