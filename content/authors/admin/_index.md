I am a grad student in Professional Computer Science at Simon Fraser University and my interests are in Deep Learning for Computer Vision and NLP. Stumbling upon [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) video on neural networks as a freshman on summer break changed my life. 

On my journey of exploring deep learning, I obtained versatile experience in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing through both industry and research positions. In my previous stints, I was a Data Intern at Eltropy, forecasting text messages for Credit Unions in the US and I was an NLP Engineer at LimeChat, boosting sales and automating customer support for D2C brands.

I graduated from NIT Trichy with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. Through my undergraduate years, I was guided by bright minds such as [Prof. Liming Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/limingchen/accueil), [Prof. CV Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). I am grateful for receiving the [Charpak Lab Scholarship](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship) which enabled me to pursue a research internship in France and the [SPDC scholarship](https://mea.gov.in/spdc.htm) which funded part of my undergraduate education.
